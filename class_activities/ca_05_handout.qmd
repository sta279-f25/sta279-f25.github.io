**Group members:**

**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor on the following activity. I will collect the handout at the end of class, and it will be part of your class participation grade. You will be graded only on effort -- it is ok if you don't finish all the questions, or get them all correct.

# More pivoting

Consider the following data from last time:

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
df_3 = data.frame(id = c(1, 2, 3),
                 bp_1 = c(100, 120, 125),
                 bp_2 = c(120, 115, 130),
                 hr_1 = c(60, 75, 80),
                 hr_2 = c(77, 81, 93))
```

```{r}
df_3
```

You run the following code, producing the output below:

```{r}
df_3 |>
  pivot_longer(cols = -id,
               names_to = c(".value", "stage"),
               names_sep = "_")
```

1. Explain what the line `names_to = c(".value", "stage")` is doing.
