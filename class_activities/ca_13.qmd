## Probability simulation: theater seating

Suppose there are exactly 100 seats in a movie theater. Further, suppose the movie theater has imposed a new ticketing system where each personâ€™s ticket has an assigned seat number. Consider the case where the movie is sold-out (all 100 seats will be taken) and the first person in the theater lost their ticket and takes a random seat. Each subsequent person attempts to go to their seat. If their seat is open, they take it. Otherwise, to avoid confrontation, they choose a random seat. 

1. Conduct a simulation to assess the probability that the last person into the theater will get their assigned seat.

*Tips:* Here are some tips for one approach to this simulation.

* Create a vector `seats`, containing the numbers 1,...,100 in order, to represent the (numbered) seats in the theater
* Create a vector, `taken`, to represent which seats have been taken. At the beginning of each run of the simulation, all entries of `taken` are 0.
* When a seat gets taken, change the corresponding entry in `taken` to 1
* Use `sample` to randomly choose a seat from the ones available
* `seats[taken == 0]` will tell you which seats are available
* It is crucial to treat the first person separately from the rest. The first person *always* chooses a random seat. The other 99 people *only* choose a random seat if their seat is already taken.
* Begin by coding one run of the simulation. That is, all 100 people take a seat. Check whether the last person in the theater got their assigned seat. Then repeat the simulation many times
* Your code may involve nesting one `for` loop inside another. If so, make sure to use different indices in your loops
