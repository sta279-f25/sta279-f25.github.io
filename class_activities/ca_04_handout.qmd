**Group members:**

**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor on the following activity. I will collect the handout at the end of class, and it will be part of your class participation grade. You will be graded only on effort -- it is ok if you don't finish all the questions, or get them all correct.


# Adult literacy data

Below are the first few rows and columns of a table containing data on the adult literacy rate in countries around the world, in each year since 1975:

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
litF <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDinTIRHQIaZg1RUn6Z_6mo12PtKwEPFIz_mJVF6P5I/pub?gid=0") |>
  rename(country = starts_with("Adult"))
litF
```

1. What does a row in this table represent?

\vspace{3cm}

2. Is the table in "wide" or "narrow" format?

\vspace{3cm}

3. If you were to reshape the table, what would you want it to look like instead? Describe what a row and column what represent in your reshaped table.
