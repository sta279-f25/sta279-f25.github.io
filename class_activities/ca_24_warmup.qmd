# `nycflights13` data

The `nycflights13` package in R contains 5 different datasets: `airlines`, `airports`, `planes`, `flights`, and `weather`. 

* For each of these tables, determine a column, or combination of columns, which could be used as the table's **primary key**. Remember that a primary key must be *unique* in the table, and can have no missing values. 

* For each of these tables, determine any **foreign keys** that reference primary keys in the other tables. 

* Work with the `nycflights13` package documentation and the data in R to identify potential primary and foreign keys. You do not need to do any SQL here.

* Finally, try to sketch an ERD for the `nycflights13` tables.
