**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor on the following activity. I will collect the handout at the end of class, and it will be part of your class participation grade. You will be graded only on effort -- it is ok if you don't finish all the questions, or get them all correct.

## Writing a data frame function

Your friend is trying to write some code, but unfortunately they are encountering some issues. Below is the code they have written, and the error message in R:

```{r, message=F, error=T}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

grouped_max <- function(df, group_var, max_var) {
  df |>
    group_by(group_var) |>
    summarize(max(max_var, na.rm=T))
}

grouped_max(penguins, species, bill_depth_mm)
```

1. What is the code *trying* to do?

2. What does your friend need to change for the code to work?
