## Student grades

You are a TA for a statistics course. The instructor of the course is interested in assessing how students performed on each assignment in the class.

You are provided with a CSV file (`student_grades.csv`), from Canvas, containing the grades for each student on each assignment in the course. Here are the instructions the professor gives you:

* There are 6 homeworks, 2 midterms, a final exam, and a project
* Each homework is scored out of 10. All other assignments are scored out of 100
* If a student did not submit an assignment, it is marked as `NA` in the CSV file. These missing assignments should receive a score of 0
