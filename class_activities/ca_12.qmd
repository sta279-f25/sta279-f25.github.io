**Instructions:** 

* Work with a neighbor to answer the following questions 
* To get started, download the [class activity template](https://sta279-f25.github.io/class_activities/ca_12_template.qmd) file
* When you are finished, render the file as an HTML and submit the HTML to Canvas (let me know if you encounter any problems)

## Probability simulation: the birthday problem

Suppose we have a class of 30 students. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday?

* Assume there are 365 days in a year
* Assume that each day is equally likely as a birthday
* Assume there are no multiple-birth siblings (e.g. twins, triplets, etc.) in the class

1. Write a simulation to estimate this probability, and report your estimate.


2. How many students do we need for the probability to be approximately 50%?
