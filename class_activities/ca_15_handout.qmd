**Group members:**

**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor on the following activity. I will collect the handout at the end of class, and it will be part of your class participation grade. You will be graded only on effort -- it is ok if you don't finish all the questions, or get them all correct.

## Functions

Below is a toy example function:

```{r, eval=F}
my_power <- function(x, y){
  x^y
}
```

For each of the following lines of code, predict what will happen when you call the function. Once you have made your predictions, check the results in R to see what happens.

1.

```{r, eval=F}
my_power(x = 2, y = 3)
```


2.

```{r, eval=F}
my_power(y = 3, x = 2)
```


3.

```{r, eval=F}
my_power(2, 3)
```


4.

```{r, eval=F}
my_power(3, 2)
```


5.

```{r, eval=F}
my_power(3)
```
