**Instructions:** 

* Work with a neighbor to answer the following questions 
* To get started, download the [class activity template](https://sta279-f25.github.io/class_activities/ca_14_template.qmd) file
* When you are finished, render the file as an HTML and submit the HTML to Canvas (let me know if you encounter any problems)

## Practice with lists

1. Each of the following lists contains the vector `c(2, 7, 9)`. Determine the correct list indexing syntax to extract that vector from the list (your code should return just the vector, *not* a list containing the vector).

```{r, eval=F}
x1 <- list(c(2, 7, 9))
x2 <- list(list(c(2, 7, 9)))
x3 <- list(c(2, 7, 9), list("a", "b"))
x4 <- list(c("a", "b"), list(list(c(2, 7, 9))))
```

2. Create a list `x5` such that the vector `c(2, 7, 9)` can be extracted with `x5[[3]][[2]][[1]]`.

3. Create a list `x` in R such that:

* `x[[1]]` returns the function `mean`
* `x[[2]]` returns the function `sd`
* `x[[3]][[1]]` returns the vector `c(0, 1, 2)`
* `x[[3]][[2]]` returns a function which calculates the cube root
