## Animals and exam stress

**Question:** Have you ever been to an event designed to help students reduce exam stress by interacting with animals (dog petting, goat yoga, etc.)?

![](https://www.cmu.edu/piper/news/archives/2020/october/images/guy-with-goat900x600-min.jpg)

## Do dogs help exam stress?

* Data collected on 284 students at a mid-size Canadian university
* Students randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: handler-only contact (control), indirect contact, and direct contact
* Well-being and ill-being measures recorded before and after treatment for each student
* Approach: compare pre/post measures of well-being and ill-being

## Recording well-being and ill-being measures

* Likert items for each well-being / ill-being measure
* Average the likert items to get a score for each measure
* E.g.:
  - Positive affect score is the average of 5 Likert items
  - Social connectedness is the average of 20 Likert items
  - Happiness is the average of 4 Likert items
  
## Example Likert item for social connectedness

"I am able to relate to my peers."

* Strongly disagree (1)
* Disagree
* Somewhat disagree
* Somewhat agree
* Agree
* Strongly agree (6)

## The raw data

* 284 rows (one per student)
* 200+ columns
* Example: social connectedness

```{r, include=F}
library(tidyverse)
raw_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ciaran-evans/dog-data-analysis/main/dog_data_raw.csv")
```

```{r, echo=F}
raw_data |>
  select(starts_with("SC"))
```

## Activity

* Need to process the raw data before it can be used to answer the research question
* Work with your neighbor to brainstorm data processing steps, then we will discuss as a class
* I will collect the handout at the end of class

## Activity

What do you want the *final* data to look like, to make it easy to answer the research question (do students who interact more with dogs see a greater reduction in stress and a greater improvement in well-being?)

## Activity

What are some of the steps that need to be done to turn the raw data into the data you *want*?

## Activity

Are you familiar with any tools (e.g. R functions) that would allow you to carry out the data processing steps?

## Activity

The original data from the Binfet *et al.* paper actually includes a *lot* more demographic information on the students (their ethnicity, gender identity, etc.). Why do you think I removed these variables before sharing the data with you?

## Class plan (tentative)

* Unit 1: Fundamentals for working with data
    * Data wrangling, functions, and iteration

* Unit 2: More on computing
    * Deeper dive on iteration, functions + function scoping, and objects in R

* Unit 3: Other data types and importing
    * Text as data, regular expressions, web scraping
    
* Unit 4: Beyond R
    * SQL + relational data, Python

## Class plan

Unit 1: Fundamentals for working with data

* tools for cleaning and processing data (modifying columns, creating new columns, subsetting rows, etc)
* working with different variable types
* reshaping data
* wrangling with multiple tables
* iteration across columns and tables
* writing functions for data wrangling

## Course goals

* Develop computing skills to work with data and answer
statistical questions
* Emphasize reproducibility and good coding practices
* Introduce other important computing tools for statistics
and data science (Python, SQL, Git)

What this course isn't:

* An exhaustive list of R or Python functions
* A computer science course
* A deep dive into how R actually works

## Expectations

* Complete any assigned reading ahead of class
* Become comfortable finding and using unfamiliar functions on your own
* Bring laptop each day
* Submit class activities (graded for effort, not completeness or correctness)
* Attend department seminars (more info to follow)

## Course components

* Class participation (graded for effort)
* HW assignments (roughly one per week)
* Exams (2 midterms, 1 final)
* Projects (2)

## AI policy

## For next time

* Make sure R and RStudio are installed
* Instructions are provided on the course website
